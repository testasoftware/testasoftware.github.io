Let's suppose you have a list of string that contain numeric values. When you sort<!--more-->\r\nthat list in .Net they probably don't get returned in the manner you'd expect. They get returned based upon their ASCII string values\r\ngiving you a list that looks something like the image below. This problem has already been <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/12/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order.html\">covered</a> <a href=\"http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2007/12/13/natural-sorting\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712.html#e20071211T054956\">extensively</a> so\r\nI'm going to quickly run through the solution I ended up using.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./badorder.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In order to sort this list into a format we expect we need a natural (logical, humanized or whatever you prefer to call it) type of\r\nsorting. After doing the quick \"research\" that brought you the above links, I noticed that explorer displayed my list of directories\r\nI have been trying to sort in the manner I desired.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./files.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This led me to find a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/248603/natural-sort-order-in-c-sharp\">post</a> on stackoverflow.com describing how to use a native Windows method -\r\n<strong>StrCmpLogicalW(string psz1, string psz2)</strong> - to do the type of comparison I desired. Native methods can be imported and easily\r\nwrapped up in some nice usable .NET!
