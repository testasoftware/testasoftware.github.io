Thanks!<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Working With a Feature Branch</h2>\n<h3>Create a Feature Branch</h3>\n<p>Every journey has to start some where. Our journey starts with a feature branch. A feature branch affords us the\nability to develop a new feature without polluting main development branch.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout -b feature_name dev</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>At this point we've created and checkout a new branch based off of our development branch. Now we can continue to work\non this branch without affecting our mainline dev branch.</p>\n<h3>Rebasing a Feature Branch With the Latest Code</h3>\n<p>As we work on our new feature, there will undoubtedly be code that is pushed up to origin/development by other developers.\nPulling that code into our feature branches gets us a couple of things. First, having the latest development branch code\nwhile were working on a feature makes merging easier. Second, if we rebase the latest code into our feature branch we\navoid some extraneous merge commits that add additional clutter to the history.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-bash\">// get the latest changes\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout development\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull -u origin development\n\n// rebase the latest changes into our feature branch\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout feature_branch\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> rebase development</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h3>Merging a Feature Branch (using interactive rebase)</h3>\n<p>Additionally, there are feature branch benefits when it comes time to push out our changes. The old adage\n'commit early, commit often' holds true during development. Many commits give developers the flexibility and\nsecurity they need. When it comes to the main branches, though, all of those developmental commit just tend to\nclutter up the history. What we really want in the main branches is a single commit that represents the feature\nwe've built. This is where interactive rebasing comes in.</p>\n<p>Here's what we're going to achieve. We're going to rewrite our feature history to include the latest changes from\nthe development branch and at the same time we're going to 'squash' all of our commits in our feature branch into\na single commit. Here's how we do this.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-bash\">// get the latest changes, same as before\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout development\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull -u origin master\n\n// perform the interactive rebase, notice the extra <span class=\"token string\">'-i'</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout feature_branch\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> rebase -i development</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This will present us with a editor that will allow us to 'pick' and 'squash' commits. For our team generally we\nwill 'pick' the first commit and 'squash' all of the other commits into that first commit. All that's needed is\nto rename 'pick' to 'squash' at the beginning of all the commits you're squashing. See the screen shot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/blog/git-workflow/git-rebase.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After you save git will then perform the rebase and squashing! All that's needed is to merge your feature branch\ninto the local/development branch and push it up to origin/development to share with the rest of the team!</p>\n<h3>Posts in This Series</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2013-01-25-git-branching-workflow-part-1-overview\">Part 1: Overview</a></p>\n<p>Part 2: Feature Branches</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 23, 2013","slug":"2013-02-23-git-branching-workflow-part-2-feature-branches","title":"Git Branching Workflow - Part 2: Feature Branches","image":"/assets/images/blog/thumbnails/tree-branch2.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"16ed6722-a57e-5210-9041-47f9426c1986","frontmatter__slug":"2013-02-23-git-branching-workflow-part-2-feature-branches","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"2013-02-23-git-branching-workflow-part-2-feature-branches"}}},
