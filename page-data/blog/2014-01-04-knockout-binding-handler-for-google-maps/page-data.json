They have a series of pages that represent their locations. To accompany the location\ninformation they wanted to display an interactive map. Google maps makes this easy enough, but with knockout it was even easier!</p>\n<p>First the data. To position a map we're going to need latitude and longitude. Google makes this process super easy with their\ngeo-coding services. We start with a model to represent our location...</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/stesta/b611de1f28ff377a2dee.js\"></script> \n<p>Then create a simple static method to use Google's geo-coding service to populate that model based on a street address that\nwe already have for the location.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/stesta/d92787de6d02e0f80b06.js\"></script>\n<p>What I actually ended up doing was using these two bits of code to update their database location records to include\nthe returned latitude and longitude. I then updated the location c-sharp and corresponding javascript models to include\nthese values when the data is returned. Having the latitude and longitude available on the frontend model made it easy to\nuse the Google Maps Javascript API to create a map.</p>\n<p>What I ended up doing was creating a Knockout binding handler to create the map.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/stesta/620d064782d35c17e773.js\"></script>\n<p>Below is a simple example of how to actually use this binding handler... <br />\n<strong>(note you need to specify a height and width for your map)</strong></p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/stesta/e9f4feb2a3dc113cac99.js\"></script> \n<p>Easy enough! 15 minutes of work!</p>\n<h3>Working Code</h3>\n<p>Additionally, here are a couple of working fiddles to demonstrate:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/stesta/2T3Db/\">Single Point, Multiple Maps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/stesta/p3ZT4/\">Multiple Points, Single Map</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 04, 2014","slug":"2014-01-04-knockout-binding-handler-for-google-maps","title":"Knockout Binding Handler for Google Maps","image":"/assets/images/blog/thumbnails/boxing.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ce060a5b-eb33-53d6-b017-e2c3889fba5b","frontmatter__slug":"2014-01-04-knockout-binding-handler-for-google-maps","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"2014-01-04-knockout-binding-handler-for-google-maps"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
