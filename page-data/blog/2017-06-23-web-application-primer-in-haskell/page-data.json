The intent is to build an actual application with dynamic front-end behavior that is in direct communication with the back-end code.</p>\n<p>In order to learn more about Haskell I decided to try and write a glorified Hello World program in the form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway's Game of Life</a>. The original iteration was console based, but I quickly began yearning for something a little more gratifying visually. Hence, the Game of Haskell webapp was born!</p>\n<h2>Technology Stack</h2>\n<p>It was important early on to make some very opinionated decisions regarding the technology stack. The following framework decisions represent my attempts at learning as many new things as possible with the caveat that these descisions should result in a new, reusable, robust and flexible toolbelt that can be applied toward future Haskell web development.</p>\n<p>Here's the hierarchy of how this application was built:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heroku\n<ul>\n<li>Docker\n<ul>\n<li>[React + ES6][]</li>\n<li>[Snap Framework + Heist + Websockets][]</li>\n<li><a href=\"/steve/blog/web-application-primer-in-haskell-programming-language\">Haskell</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Source code</strong> hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/stesta/GameOfLife\">Github</a></h3>\n<h3><strong>Pre-built image</strong> available via <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/stesta/gameoflife/\">Docker Hub</a></h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">docker pull stesta/gameoflife </code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h3><strong>Live demo</strong> deployed to <a href=\"http://game-of-haskell.herokuapp.com\">Heroku</a></h3>\n<p>Next up: <a href=\"/steve/blog/web-application-primer-in-haskell-programming-language\">Haskell and our Core Code</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 23, 2017","slug":"2017-06-23-web-application-primer-in-haskell","title":"Web Application Primer in Haskell - Overview","image":"/assets/images/blog/thumbnails/haskell.png"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a17274bd-e443-517d-b5e3-3749f7662a7d","frontmatter__slug":"2017-06-23-web-application-primer-in-haskell","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"2017-06-23-web-application-primer-in-haskell"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
